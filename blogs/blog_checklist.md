# Blog Checklist

This document provides a step-by-step checklist for what you need to do for each blog.
In order to find what blog group you belong to, please check the file that lives in this directory.

Note that you are required to give *five* blogs during your time here at Flatiron School and they will eventually need to be published.

Blogs will happen in the *third* week of each module. Blogs will happen on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of each project week.
Groups will be rotated each week by one day so you should be able to figure out what day you will present for the remainder of your time here. 
For example, if you are in *GROUP ONE* and present on *TUESDAY* of the first mod, you will present on *WEDNESDAY* of project week the second mod. 
Those that present on the Thursdsay will then move to Tuesdays.
Given this ordering, you should be able to plan all of your blogs accordingly.

Please mark them in your diaries now even though they are not in your course calendar yet.

Your first blog topic will be a post about yourself and why you got into data science.
Your later posts will focus on some sort of techncial topics.

Here are some examples of sucessful introduction and technical posts we have seen in the past:

### Introduction Posts

### Techncial Posts
