# Mod 1 Project

Welcome to your Mod 1 Project for our first unit on `Data Engineering`! 
This project contains _a lot_ of things to do this week so let's get started.

## The Project

The repository for this project is located [here](https://github.com/cenuno/opportunity_youth)!
You will `fork` the repository first and download all of the nessecary software, data, and code.

Note that you need both a lot of data that will take a bit to download as well as a specific environment for all fo your software to run.


In order to see the description for this project head over to `references/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
Here you will find the background and rationale for the project as well as a list of requirements.

Let's head over there to talk about it!
